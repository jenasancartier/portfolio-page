                <h5><strong>Why I chose to become a programmer</strong></h5>
                  <p>
                   I've always been interested in technology and software development. Many of my closest friends are successful computer programmers, and their enthusiastic interest on the subject has inevitably rubbed off on me over the years.   I come from an artistic family, with a strong background in fine arts, theatre, and film acting. I've spent the last five years persuing acting full time. I enjoy it very much, but the popular term "starving artist" has become a reality for me, and I feel it's time to pursue a career in tech. I'm excited about this change, and eager to implement my innate creativity, imagination, and problem solving skills into this new vocational venture.

              <h2>Interests</h2>
              <b class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart-empty"></b>
              <p>
                <h5><strong>Art</strong></h5>
                  <p>I enjoy making art. I typically illustrate with ink and paint with watercolors and acrylics. I am mostly self-taught, but my mother is a muralist and has passed much of her artistic wisdom on to me. I have always been fascinated with web design and I remember teaching myself basic HTML at the tender age of 11 years old so I could make the coolest looking AOL profile page of all my friends. I also enjoy interior design and I religiously follow my favorite design blogs online. </p>
                <h5><strong>Nature</strong></h5>
                  <p>
                    I love spending quality time with mother earth. I try to take hikes, explore, and go camping as often as possible. One of the reasons I moved to the pacific northwest was to be closer to the natural beauty here.
                  </p>
                <h5><strong>Conscious Living</strong></h5>
                  <p>I have strong ethical values and I believe in living consciously, kindly, and leaving the smallest environmental footprint I can. I'm a huge animal lover, a vegan, and a proud mother of two cat children, Nico and London. They are the sweest little furrikins on this planet!</p>
                <h5><strong>Music</strong></h5>
                  <p>Music has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I learned how to play the drums at 8 years old, and I haven't stopped since. I haven't had a drum set for a couple of years now, but that doesn't stop me from drumming on every surface possible. I also play the ukulele and cello.</p>
